# CHIP8
This is a simple Chip-8 emulator.
I use windows but the code shouldn't require many changes to run on linux or Mac.

# Controls

Chip 8 has a 4x4 keypad that corresponds to the following keys in the emulator:

123C
456D
789E
A0BF

==

1234
qwer
asdf
zxcv

I also implemented some extra functionality. You can change the color of the graphics with your keyboard's keypad (0-5), and pressing backspace will reset the game.
